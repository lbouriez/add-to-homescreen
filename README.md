# Add to Homescreen call out

Script for mobile devices, it automatically shows an overlaying message encouraging to add the web app to the homescreen. Compatible with iOS 6+ and Chrome for Android (soon WinPhone).

## Installation

Add `addtohomescreen.css` and `addtohomescreen.js` to the head of your projects index file. Then, call `addToHomescreen();` as soon as possible. For example:

```html
<head>
<title>Add To Home</title>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../style/addtohomescreen.css">
</head>
<body>
<!--To get the Add to Homescreen on IOS devices, see readme for more informations-->
<script src="lib/addtohomescreen.js"></script>
<script>
		const isIos = () => {
			// eslint-disable-next-line sap-no-navigator
			const userAgent = window.navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
			return /iphone|ipad|ipod/.test(userAgent);
		};
	
		// eslint-disable-next-line sap-no-navigator
		const isInStandaloneMode = () => ("standalone" in window.navigator) && (window.navigator.standalone);
	
		if (isIos() && !isInStandaloneMode()) {
			if (typeof addToHomescreen !== "undefined") {
				addToHomescreen({
					skipFirstVisit: false,
					startDelay: 0,
					displayPace: 0,
					autostart: true
				});
			} else {
				console.error("addToHomeScreen has not been imported");
			}
		}
	</script>
